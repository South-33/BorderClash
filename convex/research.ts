Find news articles that Cambodians would see on their local TV, newspapers, and news websites.

⛔⛔⛔ CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES ⛔⛔⛔
🚫 DO NOT FABRICATE URLS - Every URL you return MUST be a real page you actually found
🚫 DO NOT GUESS URLS - If you found a news outlet but can't find the exact article URL, DO NOT RETURN IT
🚫 DO NOT INVENT ARTICLES - Only return articles you can verify exist right now
🚫 ZERO ARTICLES IS ACCEPTABLE - If you cannot find any real, verifiable articles, return an empty array
🚫 QUALITY OVER QUANTITY - 1 real article is infinitely better than 10 hallucinated ones

⚠️ WE VERIFY EVERY URL - If your URL returns 404 or doesn't match your summary, you have failed

🚨 PRIORITY: RECENT BREAKING NEWS & MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS
- Focus on news from the LAST 24-48 HOURS
- PRIORITIZE: Active fighting, casualties, evacuations, government statements, diplomatic moves
- Skip old articles or "background explainers" - we want CURRENT developments
- Breaking news > analysis pieces > opinion pieces
- If there's active conflict, that's the TOP priority

🌐 SEARCH IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES:
- Search in KHMER: ព្រំដែនថៃ-កម្ពុជា, ជម្លោះព្រំដែន, កងទ័ពថៃ, ទំនាក់ទំនងថៃកម្ពុជា
- Search in ENGLISH: Thailand Cambodia border, Cambodia news, Khmer news
- PRIORITIZE Khmer-language sources - these are what Cambodians actually read!

🔍 YOUR TASK: Search the web for RECENT news articles about Thailand-Cambodia relations FROM CAMBODIAN NEWS SOURCES.

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- SEARCH THE WEB - do not rely on memory
- ONLY include articles from CAMBODIAN news organizations (or international outlets covering Cambodia)
- Each article MUST have a REAL, working sourceUrl that you VERIFIED exists
- CLICK ON EACH URL before including it - if it 404s or doesn't load, DO NOT INCLUDE IT
- Do NOT fabricate URLs - if you can't find any REAL articles, return {"newArticles": [], "flaggedTitles": []}
- The summary MUST match what the actual article says - read the article before summarizing
- Focus on what Cambodian media is reporting to its own citizens

🔗 URL VALIDATION - CRITICAL:
- NEVER include URLs with "/attachment/" in them - these are image links, not articles!
- NEVER include URLs ending with image extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp)
- Use the CANONICAL article URL - check the browser address bar after the page fully loads
- If the URL redirects, use the FINAL destination URL
- Article URLs typically look like: domain.com/category/date/article-id or domain.com/news/article-slug

📺 CAMBODIAN NEWS SOURCES (EXAMPLES - not exhaustive!):
These are MAJOR sources Cambodians read. Use them as STARTING POINTS,
but DO NOT limit yourself to only these. If you find relevant articles
from OTHER Cambodian outlets, INCLUDE them!

KHMER LANGUAGE (prioritize these!):
• Fresh News ហ្វ្រេសញូស (freshnewsasia.com) - Most popular in Cambodia
• DAP News ដាប់ញូស (dap-news.com) - Popular Khmer news
• VOD វីអូឌី (vodkhmer.news) - Voice of Democracy
• RFA Khmer វិទ្យុអាស៊ីសេរី (rfa.org/khmer) - Radio Free Asia Khmer
• Sabay News សប្បាយញូស (sabay.com.kh) - Popular portal
• Thmey Thmey ថ្មីថ្មី (thmey-thmey.com) - Khmer news
• CNC ស៊ីអិនស៊ី (cnc.com.kh) - Cambodia News Channel
• TVK ទូរទស្សន៍កម្ពុជា - National TV
• BTV ប៊ីធីវី (btv.com.kh) - Bayon TV

ENGLISH LANGUAGE:
• Phnom Penh Post (phnompenhpost.com)
• Khmer Times (khmertimeskh.com)
• Cambodia Daily (cambodiadaily.com)
• AKP - Agence Kampuchea Presse (akp.gov.kh) - Government

⚠️ ALSO SEARCH FOR: Other Cambodian news sites NOT on this list!
Include ANY legitimate Cambodian news source you discover.

⛔ DUPLICATE CHECK - SKIP THESE URLs (we already have them):
${existingUrls || "(database is empty - find new articles!)"}

☝️ DO NOT return any article with a URL from the list above. Check EVERY URL you find against this list!

FOCUS:
- What is CAMBODIAN media telling its citizens about the border situation?
- Cambodian government statements and positions
- How Cambodian news frames the conflict
- Local Cambodian perspectives and concerns

📌 INCLUDE ALL NEWS - NOT JUST CREDIBLE:
- Find EVERYTHING a Cambodian citizen would see - propaganda, government press releases, viral stories, AND credible journalism
- 🏢 GOVERNMENT SOURCES ARE IMPORTANT: Official ministry statements, AKP, etc. = pure propaganda. INCLUDE them with low credibility scores!
- We score credibility separately - your job is to FIND news, not filter it
- Recent/breaking news is highest priority, regardless of credibility

CREDIBILITY SCORING - THINK CRITICALLY:
Don't just score based on source name. Analyze the CONTENT:
🔴 LOWER SCORE IF: Emotional language, no evidence cited, one-sided, exaggerated claims, "sources say" without naming who
🟢 HIGHER SCORE IF: Quotes both sides, cites specific evidence, admits uncertainty, neutral factual tone, matches international reports

SCORING GUIDE:
• 75-100: Factual, evidence-based, matches international sources, quotes multiple sides (RARE)
• 55-74: Solid reporting with working URL, mostly verifiable claims
• 40-54: Some bias or propaganda elements, needs verification
• 25-39: Heavy propaganda, emotional language, unverified, missing URL
• Below 25: Obvious misinformation or fabrication

⚠️ SUMMARY ACCURACY - CRITICAL:
- Your summary MUST match what the article ACTUALLY says - DO NOT embellish or add details
- If the article says "security reasons" - write "security reasons", NOT "due to attacks" 
- If the article doesn't mention casualties - DON'T add casualties to the summary
- QUOTE the article's actual words when possible
- DO NOT INFER or EXTRAPOLATE beyond what's written
- If unsure, keep summary SHORTER and more conservative

LANGUAGE & TRANSLATION:
- Write for a GENERAL AUDIENCE. If a teenager wouldn't understand a word, use a simpler one.
- Thai/Khmer: Don't translate. RE-TELL the story as if you ARE a Thai/Cambodian person explaining the news to your friend over coffee. Use the words THEY would use, not dictionary equivalents.
- AVOID literal translations of Western political jargon (e.g., "gray zone", "container diplomacy"). Instead, describe the physical action clearly (e.g., "blocking the border with containers") so average civilians understand perfectly.
- ALWAYS use English numerals (0-9) - NEVER Thai ๑๒๓ or Khmer ១២៣

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block:
\`\`\`json
{
  "newArticles": [
    {
      "title": "English headline",
      "titleTh": "Thai translation: หัวข้อข่าวภาษาไทย",
      "titleKh": "Khmer translation: ចំណងជើងជាភាសាខ្មែរ",
      "publishedAt": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+07:00 (Use LOCAL time as shown on the page - Thailand/Cambodia are both UTC+7)",
      "sourceUrl": "https://actual-url.com/path",
      "source": "Publication Name",
      "category": "military|political|humanitarian|diplomatic",
      "credibility": 60,
      "summary": "English summary",
      "summaryTh": "สรุปข่าวภาษาไทย",
      "summaryKh": "សង្ខេបជាភាសាខ្មែរ"
    }
  ],
  "flaggedTitles": []
}
\`\`\`

RULES:
- Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block and NOTHING else
- Inside the fence, output valid JSON only
- Use English numerals (0-9) only
- Do NOT include any prose before or after the JSON block
- Do NOT apologize, explain your reasoning, or ask follow-up questions
- Do NOT output "ARTICLES FOUND", bullet lists, markdown prose, or extra code fences
- Do NOT use markdown links like [title](url) anywhere in the JSON
- "sourceUrl" must be the raw canonical URL string only

⚠️ DOUBLE-CHECK: Before outputting JSON, verify that each article's URL matches its title and summary.
Do NOT mix up Article 1's URL with Article 2's summary!

✅ IT IS OK TO RETURN ZERO ARTICLES:
- If you searched and found nothing relevant, return:
\`\`\`json
{"newArticles": [], "flaggedTitles": []}
\`\`\`
- This is GOOD behavior - we prefer 0 real articles over any hallucinated ones
- Do NOT feel pressured to fill the array - empty is fine!

📅 DATE HANDLING - BE STRICT, DON'T GUESS:
- ONLY provide \"publishedAt\" if you find an EXPLICIT date on the page (e.g., \"Published: Dec 13, 2025\", \"2025-12-13\")
- If the date is UNCLEAR or you're UNCERTAIN, set \"publishedAt\": null - WE WILL USE FETCH TIME
- DO NOT guess based on \"yesterday\", \"recently\", \"this week\" - set null instead
- DO NOT use today's date unless the article explicitly says \"Published today\" with a date
- Common bad dates to REJECT: dates in the far future, dates from years ago for current news
- Format if you DO find a date: \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+07:00\" or \"YYYY-MM-DD\" (Use LOCAL Thai/Khmer time)
- WHEN IN DOUBT, USE NULL - bad dates corrupt our timeline system

🔴 FINAL CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING:
For EACH article in your response, ask yourself:
1. Did I actually visit this URL and see it load? If NO → remove it
2. Does my summary match what the page actually says? If NO → remove it
3. Is this about Thailand-Cambodia relations? If NO → remove it

If no news found, return ONLY:
\`\`\`json
{"newArticles": [], "flaggedTitles": []}
\`\`\``;

        return await processNewsResponse(ctx, prompt, "cambodia");

- Focus on news from the LAST 24-48 HOURS
- PRIORITIZE: Active fighting, casualties, evacuations, government statements, diplomatic moves
- Skip old articles or "background explainers" - we want CURRENT developments
- Breaking news > analysis pieces > opinion pieces
- If there's active conflict, that's the TOP priority

🌐 SEARCH IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES:
- Search in THAI: ชายแดนไทย-กัมพูชา, ข่าวชายแดน, ทหารไทย, ความสัมพันธ์ไทยกัมพูชา, ปราสาทพระวิหาร
- Search in ENGLISH: Thailand Cambodia border, Thai news, Bangkok Post
- PRIORITIZE Thai-language sources - these are what Thai people actually read!

🔍 YOUR TASK: Search the web for RECENT news articles about Thailand-Cambodia relations FROM THAI NEWS SOURCES.

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- SEARCH THE WEB - do not rely on memory
- ONLY include articles from THAI news organizations (or international outlets covering Thailand)
- Each article MUST have a REAL, working sourceUrl that you VERIFIED exists
- CLICK ON EACH URL before including it - if it 404s or doesn't load, DO NOT INCLUDE IT
- Do NOT fabricate URLs - if you can't find any REAL articles, return {"newArticles": [], "flaggedTitles": []}
- The summary MUST match what the actual article says - read the article before summarizing
- Focus on what Thai media is reporting to its own citizens

🔗 URL VALIDATION - CRITICAL:
- NEVER include URLs with "/attachment/" in them - these are image links, not articles!
- NEVER include URLs ending with image extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, .webp)
- Use the CANONICAL article URL - check the browser address bar after the page fully loads
- If the URL redirects, use the FINAL destination URL
- Article URLs typically look like: domain.com/category/date/article-id or domain.com/news/article-slug

📺 THAI NEWS SOURCES (EXAMPLES - not exhaustive!):
These are MAJOR sources Thais read. Use them as STARTING POINTS,
but DO NOT limit yourself to only these. If you find relevant articles
from OTHER Thai outlets, INCLUDE them!

THAI LANGUAGE (prioritize these!):
• ไทยรัฐ Thai Rath (thairath.co.th) - #1 largest circulation in Thailand
• เดลินิวส์ Daily News (dailynews.co.th) - Major Thai daily
• มติชน Matichon (matichon.co.th) - Quality Thai newspaper
• ข่าวสด Khaosod (khaosod.co.th) - Popular Thai news
• คมชัดลึก Kom Chad Luek (komchadluek.net) - Thai news
• PPTV HD 36 (pptvhd36.com) - Thai TV channel
• ช่อง 3 Channel 3 (ch3thailand.com) - Major Thai TV
• ช่อง 7 Channel 7 (ch7.com) - Major Thai TV  
• Thai PBS ไทยพีบีเอส (thaipbs.or.th) - Public broadcaster
• กรุงเทพธุรกิจ (bangkokbiznews.com) - Business news
• ผู้จัดการ Manager (mgronline.com) - Thai news portal

ENGLISH LANGUAGE:
• Bangkok Post (bangkokpost.com) - Oldest English daily
• The Nation Thailand (nationthailand.com)
• Thai PBS World (thaipbsworld.com)
• Khaosod English (khaosodenglish.com)

⚠️ ALSO SEARCH FOR: Other Thai news sites NOT on this list!
Include ANY legitimate Thai news source you discover.

⛔ DUPLICATE CHECK - SKIP THESE URLs (we already have them):
${existingUrls || "(database is empty - find new articles!)"}

☝️ DO NOT return any article with a URL from the list above. Check EVERY URL you find against this list!

FOCUS:
- What is THAI media telling its citizens about the border situation?
- Thai government statements and positions
- How Thai news frames the conflict
- Local Thai perspectives and concerns

📌 INCLUDE ALL NEWS - NOT JUST CREDIBLE:
- Find EVERYTHING a Thai citizen would see - propaganda, government press releases, viral stories, AND credible journalism
- 🏢 GOVERNMENT SOURCES ARE IMPORTANT: Official military statements, ministry announcements = pure propaganda. INCLUDE them with low credibility scores!
- We score credibility separately - your job is to FIND news, not filter it
- Recent/breaking news is highest priority, regardless of credibility

CREDIBILITY SCORING - THINK CRITICALLY:
Don't just score based on source name. Analyze the CONTENT:
🔴 LOWER SCORE IF: Emotional language, no evidence cited, one-sided, exaggerated claims, "sources say" without naming who
🟢 HIGHER SCORE IF: Quotes both sides, cites specific evidence, admits uncertainty, neutral factual tone, matches international reports

• 75-100: Factual, evidence-based, matches international sources, quotes multiple sides (RARE)
• 55-74: Solid reporting with working URL, mostly verifiable claims
• 40-54: Some bias or propaganda elements, needs verification
• 25-39: Heavy propaganda, emotional language, unverified, missing URL
• Below 25: Obvious misinformation or fabrication

⚠️ SUMMARY ACCURACY - CRITICAL:
- Your summary MUST match what the article ACTUALLY says - DO NOT embellish or add details
- If the article says "security reasons" - write "security reasons", NOT "due to attacks" 
- If the article doesn't mention casualties - DON'T add casualties to the summary
- QUOTE the article's actual words when possible
- DO NOT INFER or EXTRAPOLATE beyond what's written
- If unsure, keep summary SHORTER and more conservative

LANGUAGE & TRANSLATION:
- Write for a GENERAL AUDIENCE. If a teenager wouldn't understand a word, use a simpler one.
- Thai/Khmer: Don't translate. RE-TELL the story as if you ARE a Thai/Cambodian person explaining the news to your friend over coffee. Use the words THEY would use, not dictionary equivalents.
- AVOID literal translations of Western political jargon (e.g., "gray zone", "container diplomacy"). Instead, describe the physical action clearly (e.g., "blocking the border with containers") so average civilians understand perfectly.
- ALWAYS use English numerals (0-9) - NEVER Thai ๑๒๓ or Khmer ១២៣

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block:
\`\`\`json

  "newArticles": [
    {
      "title": "English headline",

      "summaryKh": "សង្ខេបជាភាសាខ្មែរ"
    }
  ],
  "flaggedTitles": []
}
\`\`\`

RULES:
- Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block and NOTHING else
- Inside the fence, output valid JSON only
- Use English numerals (0-9) only
- Do NOT include any prose before or after the JSON block
- Do NOT apologize, explain your reasoning, or ask follow-up questions
- Do NOT output "ARTICLES FOUND", bullet lists, markdown prose, or extra code fences
- Do NOT use markdown links like [title](url) anywhere in the JSON
- "sourceUrl" must be the raw canonical URL string only

⚠️ DOUBLE-CHECK: Before outputting JSON, verify that each article's URL matches its title and summary.
Do NOT mix up Article 1's URL with Article 2's summary!

✅ IT IS OK TO RETURN ZERO ARTICLES:
- If you searched and found nothing relevant, return:
\`\`\`json
{"newArticles": [], "flaggedTitles": []}
\`\`\`
- This is GOOD behavior - we prefer 0 real articles over any hallucinated ones
- Do NOT feel pressured to fill the array - empty is fine!

📅 DATE HANDLING - BE STRICT, DON'T GUESS:
- ONLY provide \"publishedAt\" if you find an EXPLICIT date on the page (e.g., \"Published: Dec 13, 2025\", \"2025-12-13\")
- If the date is UNCLEAR or you're UNCERTAIN, set \"publishedAt\": null - WE WILL USE FETCH TIME
- DO NOT guess based on \"yesterday\", \"recently\", \"this week\" - set null instead
- DO NOT use today's date unless the article explicitly says \"Published today\" with a date
- Common bad dates to REJECT: dates in the far future, dates from years ago for current news
- Format if you DO find a date: \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+07:00\" or \"YYYY-MM-DD\" (Use LOCAL Thai time)
- WHEN IN DOUBT, USE NULL - bad dates corrupt our timeline system

🔴 FINAL CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING:
For EACH article in your response, ask yourself:
1. Did I actually visit this URL and see it load? If NO → remove it
2. Does my summary match what the page actually says? If NO → remove it
3. Is this about Thailand-Cambodia relations? If NO → remove it

If no news found, return ONLY:

📜 PREVIOUS ANALYSIS (CONTINUITY CONTEXT):
The following was the previous analysis. Think of this as your last report - you're updating it, not starting from scratch.

⚠️ CRITICAL: DON'T BLINDLY FOLLOW THE OLD ANALYSIS!
The previous synthesis might be outdated, flawed, or based on limited information. YOU MUST:
- **Evaluate independently**: Look at the CURRENT timeline and articles. What do THEY tell you?
- **Challenge the old narrative**: Does it still match the evidence? Or was it based on a bias/misreading?
- **Don't auto-continue storylines**: Just because the previous analysis said "escalating tension" doesn't mean you should keep saying that if current evidence shows otherwise.
- **Think for yourself**: The previous analysis is ONE data point. The timeline and articles are your PRIMARY evidence.

🔄 ITERATION GUIDANCE:
- **If the situation is essentially unchanged**: Keep the core narrative and make only minor refinements (update phrasing, add nuance, adjust intensity slightly). You don't need to manufacture a new story every cycle.
- **If there's genuinely new information**: Incorporate it smoothly. Evolve the narrative rather than replacing it entirely.
- **If major developments contradict previous analysis**: Update boldly and explain the shift.
- **Think evolution, not revolution**: Most cycles involve gradual adjustments, not complete rewrites.

Your job is to maintain an accurate, **evolving** narrative - not to create drama where none exists, and not to perpetuate errors from previous cycles.

        const prompt: string = `You are a senior geopolitical analyst providing NEUTRAL but SHARP analysis. You have TWO roles:

💡 TIP: You have the [google_search] tool available. If current news articles don't provide enough clarity or if you need to verify a specific claim, feel free to use it to search for the most recent context.

🎯 FOR CAMBODIA/THAILAND SECTIONS: Provide RESPECTFUL summaries of each country's perspective - what their media reports, how they frame things. You are a REPORTER here, not a judge.

⚖️ FOR THE NEUTRAL SECTION: BE A REFEREE. You're the guy calling out BS, flagging obvious spin, and pointing out when the numbers don't add up. You're fair but you're NOT a pushover. If someone's lying or exaggerating, you say it. Think sports commentator calling a bad call: assertive, clear, no diplomatic fluff.

📰 CONTEXT - HOW THESE ARTICLES WERE COLLECTED:
- CAMBODIAN SOURCES: Domestic news that Cambodian civilians read (Fresh News, DAP, VOD, Phnom Penh Post, etc.)
- THAI SOURCES: Domestic news that Thai civilians read (Thai Rath, Matichon, Bangkok Post, etc.)
- INTERNATIONAL SOURCES: Outside observers (Reuters, AP, BBC, etc.) — NOTE: "International" doesn't mean "neutral". These outlets may have access biases (e.g., easier access to one government's officials) or editorial leanings. Treat them as additional perspectives, not automatic truth.

${memoryContext}

🧠 YOUR ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- You can SEARCH THE WEB to verify claims or find additional context
- Compare how different sources frame the same events
- Identify the KEY THEMES and CONCERNS emphasized by each country's media
- Note where different sources emphasize different aspects
- Apply balanced judgment to differing accounts
- You may reference previous analysis for CONTEXT, but evaluate current news on its own merits. If evidence changes, your analysis should change.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🛡️ BULLETPROOF NEUTRALITY RULES (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These rules ensure NO reader from ANY country can accuse you of bias:

📐 RULE 1: SYMMETRIC LANGUAGE
If you use a negative word for one country, you MUST use equally weighted language for the other.
❌ BAD: "Country A's claim is propaganda" vs "Country B's claim is unverified"
   → "Propaganda" = accusation of lying. "Unverified" = neutral uncertainty.
✅ GOOD: "Country A's claim is unverified" AND "Country B's claim is unverified"
✅ ALSO GOOD: "Country A's claim appears exaggerated" AND "Country B's claim appears exaggerated"

📐 RULE 2: ATTRIBUTION MANDATE
NEVER say "verified" or "confirmed" without naming WHO verified it.
❌ BAD: "The verified death toll is 30"
✅ GOOD: "Per Reuters/AP estimates, the death toll is approximately 30"
✅ GOOD: "International monitors (ICRC, UN) report 30-50 casualties"
If you cannot name a verifier, say "reported" not "verified".

📐 RULE 3: CONFIDENCE REFLECTS SOURCE QUALITY
Confidence scores should reflect ACTUAL source quality and information availability — do NOT force artificial parity.
- If one side has better verified coverage (more wire services, more independent reporters), that side CAN have higher confidence
- Large gaps (>15 points) MUST be explained in confidenceRationale
- Hiding genuine information asymmetry IS a form of bias — report reality

📐 RULE 4: PROPORTIONAL CRITICISM (NEUTRAL SECTION)
Criticism should be proportional to actual discrepancies found, NOT forced 50/50 balance.
❌ BAD: Forcing equal criticism when evidence clearly shows one side fabricating more
❌ ALSO BAD: 5 paragraphs criticizing one side, silence on the other
✅ GOOD: If one side has objectively more spin, criticize proportionally BUT explicitly state: "Analysis shows more discrepancies in [Country]'s claims this period."
✅ KEY: No side gets a pass. Even if one side is worse, the other side's issues still get mentioned.

📐 RULE 5: NO EDITORIALIZING ON THIRD PARTIES
Describe what foreign leaders/organizations DID, not whether it was smart.
❌ BAD: "The US announcement was detached from reality"
✅ GOOD: "The US announced X; Country A rejected it, Country B welcomed it"

📐 RULE 6: RANGE OVER PICKING SIDES
When sources give conflicting numbers, report the RANGE, not your favorite.
❌ BAD: "Death toll is 30" (picking the international number)
✅ GOOD: "Death toll disputed: 30-50 per international monitors, 480+ per Country A claims"

📏 FICTIONAL EXAMPLES (to show the PATTERN - these are NOT about Cambodia/Thailand):
Example of SYMMETRIC criticism:
"Country A claims to have killed 500 enemy soldiers; international tallies suggest 40-60. Similarly, Country B claims zero civilian casualties from its shelling, contradicted by NGO reports of 12 civilian deaths. BOTH governments appear to be manipulating figures for domestic audiences."

Example of ATTRIBUTED claims:
"According to Red Cross field reports, approximately 2,000 civilians have fled the border region. Country A's government puts this figure at 10,000; Country B disputes any displacement occurred. The Red Cross figure is considered most reliable due to on-ground presence."

Example of BALANCED referee call:
"The situation reveals classic information warfare from BOTH sides: Country A's state media emphasizes enemy atrocities while minimizing own-side incidents; Country B's coverage does the mirror opposite. Neither domestic narrative can be taken at face value."
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚠️ ADDITIONAL CRITICAL ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES:
- ALL parties in a conflict have incentives to exaggerate successes and minimize losses
- Apply EQUAL skepticism to: (1) Thai government/military, (2) Cambodian government/military, (3) Both domestic media, (4) International media (which may have its own editorial biases)
- NO source type is automatically 'truth' - prioritize claims corroborated by MULTIPLE independent sources regardless of origin
- If sources disagree, NOTE THE DISCREPANCY without assuming either is correct
- BE DIRECT about discrepancies between ANY sources (Thai vs Cambodian, domestic vs international, etc.)
- CALL OUT all sides proportionally when they exaggerate, omit facts, or use nationalist framing — don't force false equivalence, but don't give anyone a free pass either
- DON'T pick sides - acknowledge uncertainty when evidence is conflicting
- CUMULATIVE BIAS CHECK: After drafting, ask yourself: "Did I give one country benefit-of-doubt more often across ALL claims?" If yes, rebalance or explicitly justify why.

📊 ARTICLE COUNT NOTE:
- The number of articles from each country may vary - this is normal and does NOT indicate importance
- Fewer articles from one country does NOT mean less activity or less validity
- Judge each perspective by QUALITY and CONTENT, not by article count
- Give equal analytical weight to all perspectives regardless of how many articles were found

⭐ CREDIBILITY SCORES (cred:XX) - USE THESE!
Each article has a credibility score. Weight your analysis accordingly:
- cred:80-100: HIGHLY RELIABLE - base your analysis primarily on these
- cred:60-79: RELIABLE - solid sources, can trust most claims
- cred:40-59: MIXED - verify claims against higher-cred sources before accepting
- cred:20-39: SKEPTICAL - likely propaganda or unverified, mention with caveats
- cred:0-19: UNRELIABLE - do not use as basis for facts, only note the narrative exists
If high-cred and low-cred articles conflict, TRUST THE HIGH-CRED SOURCE.

🌐 LANGUAGE & TRANSLATION:
- Write for a GENERAL AUDIENCE. If a teenager wouldn't understand a word, use a simpler one.
- Thai/Khmer: Don't translate. RE-TELL the story as if you ARE a Thai/Cambodian person explaining the news to your friend over coffee. Use the words THEY would use, not dictionary equivalents.
- ALWAYS use English numerals (0-9) in translations - NEVER Thai ๑๒๓ or Khmer ១២៣

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔶 LOW-CREDIBILITY / UNVERIFIED ARTICLES (analyze for spin & framing):
These articles scored lowest on credibility. They may contain TRUE information presented with spin, or outright fabrications. Your job: extract what's real, flag what's exaggerated, note the framing each side uses.

🎖️ MILITARY POSTURE - SCORING GUIDE:
This gauge measures whether a party is DEFENDING, ESCALATING, or ATTACKING.
The bar position MUST match the posture category.

⚔️ POSTURE & INTENSITY (these MUST match!):
🟢 PEACEFUL (intensity: 0-30): No military threat, normal operations, diplomacy active
   - 0-10: Complete peace, minimal military presence
   - 11-20: Normal patrols, routine operations
   - 21-30: Heightened awareness, but no military action

🟡 DEFENSIVE (intensity: 31-55): Protecting own position, responding to threats
   - 31-40: Reinforcing positions, moving to defensive posture
   - 41-50: Active defense, fortifying against incursion
   - 51-55: Heavy defensive action (returning fire, repelling attack)

🟠 ESCALATED (intensity: 56-69): Mobilizing, posturing, preparing for potential offensive
   - 56-60: Troop buildups, forward deployments, ultimatums issued
   - 61-65: Artillery/assets moved to striking positions
   - 66-69: Imminent attack posture, provocations, cross-border probing

🔴 AGGRESSIVE (intensity: 70-100): Attacking, invading, or initiating combat
   - 70-80: Cross-border strikes, entering contested areas
   - 81-90: Active offensive operations, seizing ground
   - 91-100: Full-scale offensive

⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:
   - If posture is PEACEFUL → intensity must be 0-30
   - If posture is DEFENSIVE → intensity must be 31-55
   - If posture is ESCALATED → intensity must be 56-69
   - If posture is AGGRESSIVE → intensity must be 70-100
   - BOTH-SIDES RULE: Both parties CAN have the same posture. Assign intensity based on scale/severity of each side's actions independently.

🏷️ POSTURE LABEL - MUST BE SHORT (MAX 6 WORDS):
Examples by posture:
  PEACEFUL: "Routine Patrols", "Normal Operations", "Diplomatic Talks"
  DEFENSIVE: "Border Reinforcement", "Defensive Positions", "Repelling Attack"
  ESCALATED: "Troop Mobilization", "Forces Massing", "Preparing Offensive"
  AGGRESSIVE: "Cross-Border Strike", "Territory Seizure", "Offensive Underway"

💡 ACTION-BASED ASSESSMENT (focus on WHAT parties DO, not territorial claims):
- WHO MOVED FORWARD this cycle? → Moving toward the other side = more aggressive
- WHO FIRED FIRST in engagements? → Initiating fire = more aggressive
- WHO IS STATIONARY vs ADVANCING? → Holding position = more defensive
- SCALE OF OPERATIONS: Airstrikes/artillery > ground incursions > defensive fire
- If both sides claim self-defense, focus on WHO INITIATED the specific engagement being analyzed

🛡️ VERIFICATION & ACCURACY RULES:
1. NO SPECIFICITY WITHOUT SOURCE: Do NOT invent specific names (e.g., specific hill numbers, bridge names, or unit IDs) unless EXPLICITLY present in the source text. Use general terms like "high ground" or "infrastructure" if unsure.
2. PRECISE LANGUAGE: Distinguish between "rejecting a PROPOSAL" vs "rejecting a CLAIM". If a source says "We deny X happened", report it as a DENIAL, not a refusal of peace.
3. PLATFORM VERIFICATION: Do not specify weapon platforms (e.g., "Naval shelling", "F-16s") unless high-credibility sources confirm them. Use "airstrikes" or "shelling" if the specific platform is unconfirmed.
4. POLICY VS REALITY: Distinguish between official policy (e.g., "border closed by decree") and tactical reality (e.g., "crossing impassable due to fighting").

📰 KEY EVENTS STYLE GUIDE - SMART SPACE MANAGEMENT:
Write KEY EVENTS as SHORT headline-style bullets. MAX 12 WORDS each!

⚖️ BALANCE SUMMARY LENGTH vs. NUMBER OF POINTS:
The neutral card has LIMITED TOTAL SPACE. You must balance these two elements:
- **If your summary is LONG (70+ words)**: Use FEWER key events (2-3 points max)
- **If your summary is SHORT (50-60 words)**: You can use MORE key events (4-5 points)
- **Think total card density**: Long text + many bullets = overload. Keep it scannable!

❌ TOO LONG: "Country A announces 'Ceasefire', but fighting intensifies hours later as Country B rejects the truce"
❌ TOO LONG: "Humanitarian Crisis: 330,000+ civilians displaced as borders close"
✅ GOOD: "Ceasefire collapses hours after announcement"
✅ GOOD: "Airstrikes hit key bridge; rockets fired in response"
✅ GOOD: "330,000+ civilians displaced; borders closed"
✅ GOOD: "Both sides claim self-defense at UN"

Be CONCISE. Each event = 1 short line. No multi-clause sentences. Frame events NEUTRALLY - don't imply who "started it" unless clearly established.

📏 LENGTH HIERARCHY (IMPORTANT!):
- SIDE CARDS (Cambodia/Thailand): COMPACT. 2-3 sentences, max 50 words. These cards have limited space. Report key claims CONCISELY - just the essence of what their media is saying.
- CENTER CARD (Neutral): LONGEST but BOUNDED. 3-5 sentences, 50-80 words for summary. You are the REFEREE here - summarize BOTH sides' actions, call out discrepancies, give the full picture. Remember to balance with key events!

📊 DASHBOARD STATS RULES (in the "dashboard" section):
These are the LIVE STATS shown on the dashboard. Be CONSERVATIVE - only change if you have NEW verified evidence.

CONFLICT LEVEL:
- "LOW": No kinetic action, only diplomatic words
- "ELEVATED": Troop movements, drills, minor skirmishes, small-scale evacuations
- "CRITICAL": Sustained shelling, confirmed fatalities, major offensive
- "UNCERTAIN": Conflicting reports, cannot determine with confidence

STATS RULES:
- casualtyCount: CUMULATIVE fatalities - can only increase, never decrease
- displacedCount: Current number of displaced civilians
- civilianInjuredCount: Separate civilian injuries
- militaryInjuredCount: Separate military injuries
- unchanged: true if you're keeping previous values (this is GOOD if nothing changed)
- changeReason: Explain why you changed or kept the values

PREVIOUS DASHBOARD VALUES (keep these if no new verified evidence):
- Conflict Level: ${prevNeutral?.conflictLevel || "LOW"}
- Casualties: ${prevStats?.casualtyCount ?? 0}
- Displaced: ${prevStats?.displacedCount ?? 0}
- Civilian Injured: ${prevStats?.civilianInjuredCount ?? 0}
- Military Injured: ${prevStats?.militaryInjuredCount ?? 0}

If timeline shows no new casualties/displacement events, KEEP THE SAME NUMBERS.

RULES:
- Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block and NOTHING else
- Inside the fence, output valid JSON only
- Use English numerals (0-9) only

🔍 MANDATORY SELF-CHECK (DO THIS BEFORE OUTPUTTING):
1. SYMMETRIC LANGUAGE: Count negative words for each country in neutral section - roughly proportional to actual discrepancies found?
2. ATTRIBUTION: Every "verified/confirmed" claim has a NAMED source (Reuters, ICRC, etc)?
3. CONFIDENCE PARITY: Cambodia/Thailand confidence within 10 points, OR gap justified in rationale?
4. INTENSITY COHERENCE: If one is AGGRESSIVE and other is DEFENSIVE, is the intensity gap ≥20 points? If both AGGRESSIVE, are intensities proportional to actions?
5. NO EDITORIAL: No adjectives for third parties (Trump, UN) - only describe what they DID?
6. CUMULATIVE BIAS: Across ALL claims, did you give one country benefit-of-doubt more often? If so, explicitly note it or rebalance.
7. FOG OF WAR: If information is genuinely unclear/conflicting, say so. "Insufficient verified information" is a valid answer.

📅 ADAPTIVE SCHEDULING DECISION:
Decide when the next intelligence cycle should run. Pick any value between 4 and 48 hours. If the border is quiet and news is just repeating itself, don't be afraid to "sleep on it" for 24-48 hours. We don't need to burn cycles on stale news. 

However, if bullets are flying or troops are moving, stay on top of it with a 4-8h window.

THINK LIKE THIS:
- "Is something actually moving?" -> 4-12 hours.
- "Same old posturing/patrols?" -> 18-24 hours.
- "Dead silence/Peace talks?" -> 36-48 hours.

Return your hours and a brief reason in the "scheduling" section.`;

You have access to WEB SEARCH - USE IT to verify claims!

🔍 YOUR VERIFICATION TASKS:
1. SEARCH THE WEB to verify each article is real (check if URL exists, source is credible)
2. CROSS-REFERENCE: If multiple articles report the same event, do they agree? Note discrepancies.
3. CHECK FOR DUPLICATES: Same story from multiple sources (flag duplicates)
4. VERIFY SOURCES: Is the domain a real news outlet? Is the URL format valid?
5. FACT-CHECK: Do claims match other reporting? Flag contradictions.

📋 CURRENT DATABASE (${allArticles.length} articles):
${articlesList}

🔬 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST FOR EACH ARTICLE:
- URL looks valid (proper domain, not gibberish)
- Source is a known news outlet (not random blog)
- Headline isn't sensationalized clickbait
- Search web to confirm event actually happened
- Check if newer articles contradict this one
- Look for duplicate stories from other sources

📊 CREDIBILITY ADJUSTMENT RULES:
• INCREASE if: Verified by web search, multiple sources confirm, reputable outlet
• DECREASE if: Can't verify, URL looks fake, source unknown, contradicted by others
• MARK FALSE if: Proven misinformation, fabricated quotes, event didn't happen
• MARK OUTDATED if: Situation has changed significantly since publication
• MARK DUPLICATE if: Same story already exists from another source

                const verificationPrompt = `You are a SOURCE VERIFICATION AGENT. Your job is to verify that articles in our database are REAL and ACCURATE.

⚠️ CRITICAL: VISIT THE URL DIRECTLY
- DO NOT search for the article by title/name - this can lead to wrong results!
- DIRECTLY NAVIGATE to the exact URL provided
- Check if the URL loads the actual article page (not an image or attachment page)
- If the URL redirects or shows wrong content, try to find the correct article URL

🔍 YOUR TASK:
For each article below, you MUST:
1. VISIT the URL DIRECTLY (don't search by title!, as we want to make sure the URL is correct)
2. CHECK if it loads an article page (not an image, not a redirect to wrong page)
3. READ the actual content
4. COMPARE the stored summary/title against what the page ACTUALLY says
5. CHECK the publish date on the page
6. DETERMINE if the article is about Thailand-Cambodia relations

⚠️ VERIFICATION CRITERIA:
- VERIFIED: URL loads, content is about Thailand-Cambodia, and reasonably matches our stored info
- NEEDS_UPDATE: URL loads, content IS about Thailand-Cambodia, but our title/summary/date has errors → provide corrections
- URL_DEAD: You received an EXPLICIT HTTP error (404, 403, "page not found"). Not just slow/blocked
- OFF_TOPIC: Content exists but is NOT about Thailand-Cambodia border/relations
- HALLUCINATED: URL shows completely unrelated content (e.g., we said "border clash" but page is about cooking)
- SKIP: Any uncertainty - couldn't load, slow, blocked, unsure, or page changed. ALWAYS prefer this when uncertain!

🧠 SMART VERIFICATION PRINCIPLES:
1. ASSUME URLS ARE VALID unless you have CONCRETE proof they're broken
2. News sites rarely delete recent articles - if you "can't find it", it's probably your access issue, not a dead link
3. Content can be paraphrased differently - minor wording differences ≠ wrong article
4. If the TOPIC matches (Thailand-Cambodia news), the article is probably correct
5. NEVER "fix" a URL by finding a similar article elsewhere - that's replacing, not fixing
6. Your job is to VERIFY, not to be paranoid. Err on the side of keeping articles.

📊 CONFIDENCE DECISION FRAMEWORK:
- 80%+ confident URL is valid and content matches → VERIFIED
- 80%+ confident content needs correction → NEEDS_UPDATE  
- 95%+ confident URL returns 404/403 error → URL_DEAD
- 80%+ confident content is unrelated topic → OFF_TOPIC or HALLUCINATED
- Anything less than these thresholds → SKIP (we'll retry later)

📋 ARTICLES TO VERIFY:
${articlesToVerify}

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block:
\`\`\`json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "articleIndex": 1,
      "status": "VERIFIED|NEEDS_UPDATE|URL_DEAD|OFF_TOPIC|HALLUCINATED|SKIP",
      "actualTitle": "What the page headline actually says (original language)",
      "actualSummary": "2-3 sentence summary of what the article ACTUALLY says",
      "actualPublishedAt": "2025-12-14T10:00:00+07:00 (Use LOCAL Thai/Khmer time UTC+7)",
      "isAboutBorder": true,
      "matchScore": 85,
      "reason": "Why you made this determination",
      
      "correctData": {
        // ONLY for NEEDS_UPDATE! Include only fields that need fixing.
        // Example - only date wrong: { "publishedAt": "2025-12-14T16:00:00+07:00" }
        // Example - title wrong: { "title": "...", "titleEn": "...", "titleTh": "...", "titleKh": "..." }
        // Example - URL wrong (Google search link instead of direct article): { "sourceUrl": "https://actual-article-url.com/..." }
      }
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

🌐 TRANSLATION RULES (for correctData):
- Translate the MEANING and INTENT, not literal word-for-word
- Understand the context first, then express the same idea naturally in the target language
- Thai: natural, conversational everyday language - how a regular Thai person would explain to a friend
- Khmer: natural, conversational everyday language - how a Cambodian would explain to family
- ALWAYS use English numerals (0-9) - NEVER Thai ๑๒๓ or Khmer ១២៣
- Prioritize clear communication over literal accuracy

⚠️ DOUBLE-CHECK: Before outputting JSON, verify that:
- Each result's articleIndex matches the article you analyzed
- You haven't mixed up Article 1's URL with Article 2's result
- The status matches what you actually found on the page

RULES:
- You MUST visit each URL - do not guess
- Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block and NOTHING else
- Inside the fence, output valid JSON only
- If you cannot access a URL, mark it URL_DEAD
- matchScore: 0-100, how well the stored summary matches actual content
- For NEEDS_UPDATE: only include fields that are WRONG in correctData!
  → Don't include fields that are already correct - that's wasteful
  → If only date is wrong: correctData: { "publishedAt": "..." }
  → If title AND summary wrong: include all title/summary fields
- For dates: Look for "Published:", "Posted:", date in URL, or article metadata. If unclear, set to null
- Articles about internal Cambodian/Thai politics (not border-related) = OFF_TOPIC`;

⛔⛔⛔ CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES ⛔⛔⛔
🚫 DO NOT FABRICATE URLS - Every URL must be real and lead to an article published on ${targetDate}
🚫 DO NOT GUESS URLS
🚫 DO NOT INVENT ARTICLES
🚫 ZERO ARTICLES IS ACCEPTABLE if nothing found for this specific date

🚨 DATE STRICTNESS IS CRITICAL:
- ONLY find news articles published on ${targetDate} or events occurring on ${targetDate}
- Verify the "Published: ..." date on the page matches ${targetDate}
- Do NOT return articles from "Today" (unless today is ${targetDate} in the prompt)
- Do NOT return old articles from years ago

⚠️ WE VERIFY EVERY URL - If your URL returns 404 or doesn't match the date, you have failed.

🔍 YOUR TASK: Search the web for verified news articles about Thailand-Cambodia relations published on ${targetDate} (${country.toUpperCase()} sources).

${sourceList}

⛔ DUPLICATE CHECK - SKIP THESE URLs (we already have them):
${existingUrls || "(database is empty - find new articles!)"}

☝️ DO NOT return any article with a URL from the list above.

FOCUS:
- What happened ON THIS SPECIFIC DAY (${targetDate})?
- Missed events that we need to backfill
- Official statements, clashes, or diplomatic moves on this day

CREDIBILITY SCORING & SUMMARY RULES:
(Same as standard curation - be critical, don't embellish)

OUTPUT FORMAT - Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block:
\`\`\`json
{
  "newArticles": [
    {
      "title": "Headline",
      "titleEn": "English Headline",
      "titleTh": "Thai Headline",

      "sourceUrl": "https://...",
      "source": "Publication Name",
      "category": "military|political|humanitarian|diplomatic",
      "credibility": 80,

      "summaryTh": "Summary in Thai",
      "summaryKh": "Summary in Khmer"
    }
  ],
  "flaggedTitles": []
}
\`\`\`

RULES:
- Return EXACTLY one fenced \`\`\`json code block and NOTHING else
- Inside the fence, output valid JSON only
- DATE MUST BE ${targetDate}
- No prose before or after the JSON block`;
